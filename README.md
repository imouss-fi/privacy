# 3alej: Privacy policy
Welcome to 3alej app for Android!


As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. The Data created by the user is stored in our Database in order to improve the foncionalities of our Application and give the best experience for our user.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
IMOUSSAINE Fatiha.
